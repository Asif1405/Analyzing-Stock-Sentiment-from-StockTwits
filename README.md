# Analyzing-Stock-Sentiment-from-StockTwits

### Overview:
In this project, I built a deep learning model to classify the sentiment of messages from StockTwits, a social network for investors and traders. The model is able to predict if any particular message is positive or negative. From this, the model was able to generate a signal of the public sentiment for various ticker symbols.

### Requirements:
Python 3.x
